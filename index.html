                    An intervention is the process of gathering friends and
                    family members with an addicted loved one, with the goal of
                    getting the addict into a recovery program, or deciding to
                    take the first step towards change. As you will learn, they
                    are not all the same. We understand that many people
                    experience addiction and its effects in different ways.

                    addiction intervention program. We also take pride is
                    offering support after the intervention to make sure that
